A DFARow defines a row in a DFA table. It contains

    - d_final:  the rule matched when this state cannot continue (or 0)

    - d_transit: the unordered map linking an input symbol (category) 
                 to a row in a DFA table. The key is the input symbol
                 category, the value the row index.

    A Usage object determines the number of different input symbol
categories. 

Subset construction (ASU) is used to determine the row to transit to.

When d_states contains the final state of a rule d_final is set to the rule's
number. When d_final is already set then it is overwritten if the current rule
number precedes d_final's value. This eventually allows us to find the active
rules by simply walking the lines of the DFA and marking the d_final
rules. Those that aren't marked aren't matched.

When a rule's accept state is encountered DFAaccept[rule] is set to the DFA
row index. DFA index 0 is never used. Moreover, the accept state is flagged as
`inheriting' or `non inheriting' (see README.lookaheads)

Subset construction results in a set of states, of the d_states array. For each
character in the alphabet a new set of states is determined. If the set isn't
already found in the DFA it is added to it.

    - d_states: the set of states defining this row
