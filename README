 Flexc++ was designed after `flex'. Flexc++ offers as compared to flex's C++
option a cleaner class-design.

Flexc++'s repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/flexcpp
and is not maintained at this location anymore.

The project's web-page can be found at http://fbb-git.gitlab.io/flexcpp/
