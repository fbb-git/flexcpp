<h1 >Chapter 6: Technical documentation</h1> 
Starting point of the analysis is the parser. The parser needs access to
<code >States</code> and <code >Rules</code>. The parser is described <a href="flexc++06.html#PARSER">here</a>.
<p>
After some preliminary definitions <strong >flexc++</strong> defines its <code >Parser</code>
object. The parser's main tasks are these:
    <ul>
    <li><code >parse</code>: the input is analyzed, resulting in the definitions of
<em >rules</em>. Each regular expression consists of a series of states, summarized
by <code >Patterns</code> and an <em >action block</em>. Action blocks may be empty, and may
be identical for subsequent regular expressions. A <code >Pattern</code> plus action
block (plus maybe a begin-of-line indicator) becomes a rule which 
is added to the <code >Rules</code> object. The first regular expression in the input
file becomes rule 0.
    <li><code >addLopStartConditions</code>: once the input has been parsed, and LOP-rules
were recognized the LOP start conditions need a catch-all rule. The catch-all
rule looks like this:
        <pre>

    .|\n        lop3_();
        
</pre>

    and is added by the scanner to the input once all input files have been
processed. This rule is then used in the LOP-tail matching procedure,
explained in section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOOKAHEAD">6.10</a>. 
    </ul>
<p>
After parsing the <code >Rules</code> object's <code >handleLopRules</code> adds a catch-all rule
to the <code >LOP</code> rule processing code. This member also updates the LOP-rules
action blocks, calling <code >lop1_, lop2_, lop3_</code> and <code >lop4_</code>. Again:
refer to section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOOKAHEAD">6.10</a> for details.
<p>
Rather than using the characters groups of characters are combined, forming
clusters or ranges. This way the DFAs do not need column entries representing
the individual input characters, but only need columns representing the
categories, usually resulting in strongly reduced column dimensions. The
ranges are determined by the <code >Ranges</code> object. These ranges can only be
determined once the regular expressions have been analyzed, which is why the
<code >Ranges</code> object is defined and performs its actions after the parser has
completed its work.
<p>
Once the ranges and the states of the regular expressions have been
determined, the DFAs can be constructed. A DFA is constructed for each start
condition (i.e. start condition) by the <code >DFAs</code> object.
<p>
Finally, a <code >Generator</code> generates the output files. The <code >Generator</code> reads
the skeleton files, copying them to their destinations which inserting
information (like the range definitions and DFA tables) which was created
before. 
<p>
<a name="NOTATION"></a><a name="l36"></a>
<h2 >6.1: Notation, Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
    <li><code >BOL</code>: Begin-of-line.
    <li><code >LOP</code>: the lookahead operator (<code >/</code>).
    <li><code >RE</code>: A regular expression.
    <li><code >F</code>: A final state.
    <li><code >x[y]</code>: at state <code >x</code> an empty transition to state <code >y</code> is allowed.
        See figure <a href="flexc++06.html#NFA1FIG">2</a>.
    </ul>

<a name="l37"></a>
<h3 >6.1.1: Example of LOP-patterns</h3>
            When an <code >F</code> state of a LOP pattern is reached and there is no
continuation at that point then the pattern until the A0 state is considered
matched and is returned.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The pattern <code >a/a+</code>:

<figcaption >Figure 2: The pattern a/a+</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Here, State 2 is the Final state
<p>
<li> The pattern <code >a*/aaa</code>: All <code >a</code> symbols until
        the F-state (state 5) has been reached are counted:

<h2 >6.2: The parser</h2>
    The parser is called like this:
        <pre>

    Parser parser(rules, states);
    parser.parse();
        
</pre>

The constructor performs no other tasks than initializing the Parser object.
<code >Rules</code> and <code >states</code> are still empty at this point.
<p>
The <code >parse</code> function was generated by <strong >bisonc++</strong>(1). It's better
understood from the grammar description <code >parser/grammar</code>: The grammar's
start rule is
        <pre>

    input:
        opt_directives
        section_delimiter
        rules
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
<code >parser/inc/rules</code>: The directives are not covered yet in this section. A
rule is defined as:
        <pre>

    rules:
        rules _rule
    |
        // empty
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
As a notational convention, all non-terminals not used outside of the file in
which they are defined start with an underscore. Furthermore, wherever
possible rules are defined before they are used. This cannot always be
accomplished, e.g., when defining indirectly recursive rules.
<p>
A <code >_rule</code> is a rule definition followed by a newline:
        <pre>

    _rule:                      
        _rule_def '\n' reset
    ;                               
        
</pre>

<p>
The <code >reset</code> non-terminal merely calls <code >Parser::reset</code>, preparing the
parser for the next rule, resetting various data members to their original,
begin-of-line states. See <code >parser/reset.cc</code> for details.
<p>
A <code >_rule_definition</code> may be empty, but usually it consists of a rule
optionally valid for a set of start conditions (<code >optMs_rule</code>, or it is a
rule or series of rules embedded in a start condition compound (<code >msComound</code>):
        <pre>

    _rule_def:
        // only an empty line is OK
    |
        // recovery from errors is OK: continue at the next line
        error       
    |
        optMs_rule
    |
        msCompound
    ;
        
</pre>

    The <code >msCompund</code> isn't interesting by itself, as it repeats
<code >optMs_rule</code>, but without the start condition specifications for the individual
rules. 
<p>
An <code >optMs_rule</code> is a rule (<code >_optMs_rule</code>), optionally followed by an
action:
        <pre>

    optMs_rule:
            // just regular expressions, without an action block
        _optMs_rule 
    |
        // the scanner returns a block if it encounters a non-blank character
        // on a line after ws, unless the character is a '|'
        _optMs_rule action
        {
            assignBlock();
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
An <code >_optMS_rule</code> defines one or more rules, sharing the same action
block: 
        <pre>

    _optMs_rule:                             // after ORNL continue parsing
        _optMs_rule ORNL '\n' reset _optMs_rule // at a new line
        {
            orAction();
        }
    |
        _optMs_regex
        {
            addRule($1, true);  // true: reset the miniscanner spec to INITIAL
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

    And an <code >_optMS_regex</code>, finally, is a regular expression or EOF-pattern,
optionally prefixed by a start condition specification:
        <pre>

    _optMs_regex:       
        ms_spec regexOrEOF
        {
            $$ = $2;
        }
    |
        regexOrEOF
    ;
        
</pre>

    A <code >regexOrEOF</code> defines exactly that:
        <pre>

    regexOrEOF:
        _regex
    |
        EOF_PATTERN
        {
            $$ = eofPattern();
        }
    ;
        
</pre>

<p>
Actions are defined <a href="flexc++06.html#BLOCKS">here</a>; the <code >Rules</code> class is described
<a href="flexc++06.html#RULES">here</a>; Regular expressions (i.e., <code >regex</code>) are described
<a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERNS">here</a>.
<p>
<a name="STARTCOND"></a><a name="l39"></a>
<h2 >6.3: Start Conditions and the class StartConditions</h2>
    Start conditions are handled by a <code >StartConditions</code> object. Each start
condition's name and start condition information is stored in <code >d_sc</code>, an
<code >FBB::LinearMap</code>, the first one being the <code >INITIAL</code> start condition.
<p>
Start condition information consists of the start condition's type and a
vector of <code >size_t</code> values, being the rule indices of the rules that were
defined for this start condition.
<p>
Additional members are <code >d_endUserSC</code>, storing <code >d_sc's</code> size after all user
defined start conditions have been inserted into <code >d_sc</code>. As all user-defined
start conditions must have been declared in the declaration section, this
value is known before start conditions are created by <strong >flexc++</strong> when encountering
LOP-rules.
<p>
Furthermore, a member <code >d_active</code> hold pointers to all currently active start
conditions. E.g., when specifying <code >&lt;INITIAL,str&gt;</code> then the rules defined for
this tag are active are added to the set if rules defined for
<code >StartConditions_::INITIAL</code> and <code >StartConditions_::str</code>.
<p>
When LOP-rules having variable sized tails are used, <strong >flexc++</strong> defines a catch-all
rule which is mathed while <code >lex_</code> is trying to match the LOP-rule's tail,
but as yet failed to do so. When it is defined this catch-all rule does not
belong to a particular start condition. This is relized through the member
<code >StartConditions::acceptRule</code>, expecting a <code >bool</code> argument. By default
recognized rules are added to the current set of active start conditions, but
the catch-all rule should not be added to any active set. Instead it is
added to the DFAs calling <code >lop3_</code>. Once the input files have been
processed, <code >Rules::handleLopRules</code> is called, and this member adds the final
(catch-all) rule to <code >d_rules</code>, without adding it to any of the available
start conditions.
<p>
<a name="BLOCKS"></a><a name="l40"></a>
<h2 >6.4: Code (action)  blocks</h2>
    The block of <strong >C++</strong> code is simply parsed from the first <code >{</code> until the
final matching <code >}</code>, acknowledging comment, strings and character constants.
<p>
The scanner merely recognizes the beginning of an action (block), returning
<code >Parser::BLOCK</code> from its <code >handleCharAfterBlanks</code> member. Then,
<code >Parser::block</code> calls <code >Scanner::lex()</code> until it observes the end of the
action statement or block. 
<p>
The parser stores the block's content in its <code >d_block</code> member for later
processing by <code >Rules::add</code>.
<p>
<a name="STATE"></a><a name="l41"></a>
<h2 >6.5: The class State</h2>
    Objects of the class <code >State</code> describe one single state of a RE
<a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERNS">pattern</a>. A <code >State</code> contains/offers:
    <ul>
    <li><code >d_type</code>: the type represented by the State (EMPTY, FINAL, CHARSET,
        BOL), the internally used <code >UNDETERMINED_</code> and <code >EOF_</code> types, or
        (initially) the ascii-value of a single character. Once the character
        ranges have been determined (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#RANGES">6.11</a>), which happens
        in ./main.cc `ranges.determineSubsets()' the type contains the
        (0-based) range index, and states reprenting character sets also
        contain the set of character range-indices that apply to those sets
        (this is implemented in ./main.cc's line ranges.finalizeStates()').
        No other type may occur (if another type is encountered <strong >flexc++</strong> contains
        an internal logic error and the program terminates in a fatal
        exception).
    <li><code >d_rule</code>: an index into the <a href="flexc++06.html#RULES">Rules</a> object to the
        <a href="flexc++06.html#RULE">rule</a> object defining the pattern;
    <li> A shared pointer to <code >StateData</code>. The class <code >StateData</code> contains
        two indices: the <code >State</code> indices of the states following the current
        <code >State</code> (or 0 if this state represents a final state). The second
        index (<code >d_next2</code>) may be 0, indicating that there is no second
        continuation state. It is unequal 0 when the
        <em >alternate</em> operator (<code >'|'</code>) is used in a RE.
    </ul>
<p>
Starting from a pattern's initial state all its subsequent states can
therefore be reached by visiting  the indices stored in
<code >StateData</code>. 
<p>

</figure></p>

<p>
<a name="STATES"></a><a name="l42"></a>
<h2 >6.6: States</h2>
    The <code >States</code> class object stores all the states defined by all <code >Pattern</code>
objects (<code >d_states</code>). When a new pattern is requested the member <code >next</code> or
<code >next2</code> can be invoked to obtain the next or next two free states. Since
concatenating pattern produces free states (cf. the description of the
<a href="flexc++06.html#CONCAT">pattern concatenation</a>) a vector of free state indices is
maintained by the <code >States</code> class as well (<code >d_free</code>).
<p>
<a name="STATESNEXTTWO"></a>
The member <code >next2</code> returns a pair of free state indices, the second state
index refers to a <code >State</code> that has been initialized to the end-of-pattern
state: its state type is <code >State::FINAL</code> and its two successor (next)
fields are set to 0, indicating that there is no continuation from this state.
<p>
Patterns consisting of multiple states (like the pattern <code >ab</code>, consisting of
the state holding <code >a</code> and the state holding <code >b</code>) are stored in a
linked-list like structure, implemented using the <code >States</code>'s <code >d_state</code>
vector. Its representation is as follows (cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#STATECATFIG">5</a>:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> The <code >next1()</code> member of the state containing the <code >a</code> pattern
returns the index of the state containing the <code >b</code> pattern.
    <li> The <code >next1()</code> member of the state containing the <code >b</code> pattern
returns the index of the final state
    <li> The final state's <code >next1</code> and <code >next2</code> members return 0
    <li> Except for the pattern using the <code >|</code>-operator (<code >pattern |
pattern</code>) all <code >next2</code> members return 0. The implementation of the
<code >|</code>-operator is described <a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERNVALOR">here</a>.
    </ul>

<p>
<a name="RULES"></a><a name="l43"></a>
<h2 >6.7: Rules and the class Rule</h2>
    All rules (combinations of RE describing <code >Pattern</code> objects and associated
action blocks) are accessible from the <code >Rules</code> object. The <code >Rules</code> object
contains a reference to the <em >states</em> (see <a href="flexc++06.html#STATES">here</a>), and a vector
<code >d_rules</code> containing the information about each of the rules, and a hash
table linking a final state index back to its rule number (see figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#RULESFIG">6</a>)
<p>
<p><a name="RULESFIG"></a><figure >
<img src="images/rules.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 6: The Rules class</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
When the parser has recognized a rule it calls <code >Rules::add</code>. A <code >Rule</code>
object is added to <code >d_rules</code>, storing begin and end state indices, a flag
indicating whether or not this rule's RE started at BOL. A rule also contains
the code of any action block that's associated with it (empty if there are no
actions), see also section <a href="flexc++06.html#BLOCKS">6.4</a>.
<p>
<code >Rules::add</code> also stores the association between the rule's final state and
rule index in its <code >unordered_map d_finalToRule</code>. Furthermore, it calls
<code >d_startConditions.add(ruleIdx)</code> to store the rule index at the currently
active start conditions. See section <a href="flexc++06.html#STARTCOND">6.3</a> for the class
<code >StartConditions</code>. 
<p>
States of rules using the LOP need access to the rule to which they
belong. For those rules <code >Rules::setRuleIndices</code> is called to assign the
<a href="flexc++06.html#STATE">State's</a> <code >d_rule</code> field. 
<p>
<a name="RULE"></a>
The <code >Rule</code> object themselves have an organization shown in figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#RULEFIG">7</a>. 
<p>
Rules starting with <code >^</code> can only be matched at <em >begin-of-line</em>
(BOL). The data member <code >d_bol</code> of such rules is set to <code >true</code>.
<p>
Rules that are matched in some DFA state are <em >viable</em>: such rules can be
matched. See section <a href="flexc++06.html#VIABLE">6.15</a> for a description of the algorithm that is
used for finding (non)viable rules.

<h2 >6.8: Converting REs to Patterns</h2>
    The various types of REs are converted to <code >Pattern</code> objects (cf. section
<a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERNS">6.9</a>). Basically, a <code >Pattern</code> contains the begin- and end-states
of a RE. 
<p>
Various types of REs are processed by various class-type factory functions,
constructing <code >Pattern</code> objects. The file <code >parser/inc/regexoreof</code> uses
these factory functions when their type of RE has been recognized. 
<p>
<ul>
    <li> Character class type of REs (e.g., <code >[[:digit:]]</code>) are handled by
        <code >class CharClass</code> (cf. section <a href="flexc++06.html#CHARCLASS">6.8.1</a>);
    <li> Interval-type of REs (e.g., <code >{1, 3}</code>) are handled by <code >class
        Interval</code> (cf. section <a href="flexc++06.html#INTERVAL">6.8.2</a>);
    <li> Single characters and characters in (raw)strings are directly handled
        by <code >Pattern::rawText</code> factory functions. Strings are received
        as-is, and their surrounding double quotes are removed before
        <code >rawText</code> is called. The contents of rawstrings is directly received
        from the scanner. Escaped characters in strings are unescaped before
        they are processed by <code >Pattern::rawText</code>.
    <li> Multipliers (<code >*, +, ?</code>) are directly handled by <code >Pattern</code> factory
        functions, receiving the regular expression and the multiplier, and
        returning a new <code >Pattern</code> incorporating the multiplication.
    <li> Concatenation is handled by the <code >Pattern::concatenate</code> factory
        function;
    <li> Alternatives (operator <code >|</code>) are handled by the
        <code >Pattern::alternatives</code> factory function;
    <li> LOP REs are handled by the parser's <code >lookahead</code> member, calling
        <code >Pattern</code> constructors defining lookahead patterns.
    <li> The <code >&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> end-of-file pattern is handled by the
        <code >Pattern::eof</code> factory function.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="CHARCLASS"></a><a name="l45"></a>
<h3 >6.8.1: The class CharClass</h3>
        The characters of a character class are made available through <code >CharClass</code>
objects. A <code >CharClass</code> object initially stores all characters of its set in
a <code >string</code>, while remembering the offsets where series of ordinary
characters or predefined character ranges start in a vector of <code >pair&lt;size_t,
CharType&gt;</code> objects. Their <code >first</code> members are indices in the object's
<code >string</code> data member where one or more characters of type <code >CharType</code>
start. 
<p>
<code >CharType</code> is an enum having values <code >CHAR</code>, indicating a plain character;
<code >PREDEF</code>, indicating a character in a predefined range; and <code >END</code>, which
is used for offset <code >d_str.length()</code>.
<p>
Once all elements of a character class have thus been collected, the member
<code >str</code> may be called to create the final character set.
<p>
The member <code >set</code> creates the final set of characters. It calls
<code >handleMinusAndEscapes</code> to find (tag) all minus characters in <code >d_str</code>, and
to process any escape sequence that may have been used in the set. Since <strong >flexc++</strong>
2.00.00 escape sequences inside character sets are supported. Thus, to
represent a literal minus character <code >\-</code> can be used. The member
<code >handleMinusAndEscapes</code> passes each of the sub-strings in <code >d_str</code>
(starting at the elements in <code >d_type</code>) to <code >inspect</code>. <code >Inspect</code> only
inspects <code >CHAR</code> ranges. It processes all escape-sequences in the <code >CHAR</code>
range, and stores the locations of unescaped minuses in <code >d_tag</code>, thus
tagging the locations of potential character-range operators. The tags of minus
characters that are used as the first or last character in <code >d_str</code> are
removed, as initial or final minus characters do not define a range.
<p>
Next, the tagged minus characters are inspected. These minuses must define
valid ranges, which means:
        <ul>
        <li> They are not bordered, either to the left or to the right, by
            predefined character ranges;
        <li> The next range tag does not refer to two character locations
            further (i.e., <code >a-c-g</code> is an invalid range: two ranges may not
            share a common boundary);
        <li> The position of the first character of a character range may not
            exceed the second character's position in the <code >char</code> collating
            sequence. Here, <strong >flexc++</strong> uses the standard (signed) 8-bit <code >char</code>
            type. 
        </ul>
<p>
All characters found in <code >d_str</code> to the left of a range are then inserted
into a <code >set&lt;char&gt;</code>. Next the characters of the character range are
inserted. Once all character ranges have thus been processed, any trailing
characters are added to <code >d_str</code>. 
<p>
The member <code >str()</code> receives the set, stores its elements in <code >d_str</code>, and
returns <code >d_str</code>. Although currently not used by <strong >flexc++</strong>'s implementation,
<code >str</code> also sets the <code >CharClass</code> object's <code >d_state</code> to <code >FINAL</code>: once a
<code >CharClass</code>'s state is <code >FINAL</code> its <code >d_str</code> is not modified anymore, and
<code >str</code> will return <code >d_str</code> without calling <code >set</code>.
<p>
<a name="INTERVAL"></a><a name="l46"></a>
<h3 >6.8.2: The class Interval</h3>
        The class <code >Interval</code> is a simple support class defining the lower and upper
bounds of an interval as <code >size_t</code> values. It uses <code >std::string</code> conversion
functions to convert values stored in text format in <code >std::string</code> arguments
to <code >size_t</code> values.
<p>
The class defines two <code >size_t</code> values (<code >d_lower</code> and <code >d_upper</code>) and
several factory members as well as members to access <code >d_lower</code> and
<code >d_upper</code>'s values.
<p>
<a name="PATTERNS"></a><a name="l47"></a>
<h2 >6.9: Patterns</h2>
    <code >parser/rules/pattern</code>: Patterns define the regular expressions that can be
matched. All patterns start at <code >pattern_ws</code> and consist of:
        <pre>

    pattern_ws:
        pattern opt_ws mode_block
    ;
        
</pre>

    Following the recognition of a pattern, the scanner is reset to its
<code >block</code> mode, allowing it to recognize a <strong >C++</strong> action block. Blocks are
defined <a href="flexc++06.html#BLOCKS">here</a>.
<p>
The following patterns are defined (more extensive descriptions follow):
    <ul>
    <li><code >EOF_PATTERN</code>  - recognized by the lexer, matching <code >&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code>. 
    <li><code >STRING</code> - recognized by the lexer, matching a literal string.
    <li><code >SECTION_DELIMITER</code> - recognized by the lexer. The <code >%%</code> sequence in
        fact ends the rule section 
    <li><code >character_class</code>: a self-defined or predefined character class like
        <code >[a-c]</code> or <code >[[alpha]]</code>.
    <li><code >plain_characters</code>: any plain character, like <code >a</code> in <code >ape</code>.
    <li><code >ESCAPE_SEQUENCE</code>: characters defined by escape sequences, like
        <code >\x2a</code>. To the parser they are plain characters. 
    <li><code >'.'</code>: the any-character-but-newline matching pattern.
    <li><code >pattern pattern</code>: two patterns immediately following each other. These
two patterns have the precedence of <code >CHARACTER</code>, and are combined 
left-associatively.
    <li><code >pattern '|' pattern</code>  Two alternative continuations.
    <li><code >pattern multiplier</code>: multipliers are <code >*, +</code> and <code >?</code>.
    <li><code >'(' incParen pattern ')' decParen</code> a pattern nested in parentheses
    <li><code >pattern '{' start_interval_m  interval '}' regex_block_m</code> a repetition
        using curly braces (an interval repetition)
    <li><code >pattern '/' pattern</code> a lookahead pattern ($ is handled by the scanner)
    </ul>
<p>
<code >Pattern</code> objects contain (and offer, through the members <code >begin</code> and
<code >end</code>) index values in the <code >States::d_states</code> of <code >State</code> objects. The
value returned by <code >Pattern::begin()</code> is the index of the first <code >State</code>
defining the pattern, the value returned by <code >Pattern::end()</code> is the index
of the last (so: <code >State::FINAL</code>) <code >State</code> of the pattern (cf. figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERN">8</a>).
<p>
<p><a name="PATTERN"></a><figure >
<img src="images/pattern.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 8: Pattern objects</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
<code >Pattern</code> objects also have a <code >d_lopData</code> data member, which is a pointer
to an internally used <code >LopData</code> struct. This data member is only used with
LOP-patterns, and is covered in section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPPATTERN">6.10.2</a>.
<p>
<code >parser/rules/pattern</code>: the following descriptions of the working of some
basic patterns illustrate how the vector of <code >State</code> objects in <code >States</code> is
filled. Based on this description other pattern's implementations should be
evident.
<p>
A basic pattern is the plain character (<code >parser/inc/regexoreof:
_single_char</code>, processed by the <code >Pattern::rawText</code> factory function). The
plain character pattern is processed as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> First the indices of two free <code >State</code> vector locations are
requested (see <a href="flexc++06.html#STATESNEXTTWO">the <code >next2</code> description</a> in the
<a href="flexc++06.html#STATES"><code >States</code> clas</a>).
    <li> The <code >State</code> at the first state index is then set to a state
containing the plain character, linking to the next free state which has been
initialized to the <code >FINAL</code> state by <code >States::next2</code>.
    <li> Then s <code >Pattern</code>, storing the begin and end <code >State</code> indices, is
returned (cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERNVALPLAIN">9</a>).
    </ul>
<p>
<p><a name="PATTERNVALPLAIN"></a><figure >
<img src="images/patternvalplain.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 9: A plain character pattern</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
<a name="PATTERNVALOR"></a>
<a name="CONCAT"></a>Concatenation of two patterns always produces a free <code >State</code> that can be
returned by, e.g., <code >State::nex2</code>. The states, defining a pattern, 
therefore, do not have to be consecutively stored in the <code >States</code>'s vector
of <code >State</code> objects (see figure <a href="flexc++06.html#CONCATFIG">10</a>).
<p>
<ul>
    <li> Concatenation starts with two <code >SemVal</code> objects.
    <li> The <code >SemVal</code> objects are downcast to,
resp. a <code >lhs PatternVal</code> and a <code >rhs PatternVal</code>.
    <li> With lookahead patterns, the <code >lhs</code> pattern may be an <em >accepting
state</em>. I.e., once the full pattern has been recognized only the lhs is
actually matched. E.g., after recognizing <code >a/b</code> <code >a</code> is returned as
matched, as <code >a</code> is the accepting pattern. When concatenating the lhs's end
state disappears and is replaced by the rhs's begin state. Therefore:
    <li> The rhs's begin state's accepting flag is set to the lhs's end
state's accepting flag.
    <li> The <code >lhs.end()</code> state is assigned the value of the <code >rhs.begin()</code>
state
    <li> The <code >rhs.begin()</code> state is marked as free
    <li> A new <code >Pattern</code> is returned, having its
<code >begin</code> index set to <code >lhs.begin()</code> and its <code >end</code> idex set to
<code >rhs.end()</code>. 
    </ul>

<a name="LOOKAHEAD"></a><a name="l48"></a>
<h2 >6.10: Patterns using the lookahead operator (LOP)</h2>
    The way the lookahead operator (LOP, <code >/</code>) is handled has
completely changed at <strong >flexc++</strong>'s upgrade from version 1 to version 2. The
LOP-handling algorithm used in <strong >flexc++</strong> versions before 2 worked correctly in
most situations, but we were unable to prove its correctness, and over time
bugs in the algorithm were uncovered which often were very hard to squash. 
<p>
On the other hand, the algorithm implemented since <strong >flexc++</strong> version 2 is
surprisingly simple and can be proven to work.
<p>
The philosophy underlying the current LOP algorithm is simply that, in order
to match <code >{head}/{tail}</code>, where <code >{head}</code> and <code >{tail}</code> are regular
expressions, the scanner must at least be able to match <code >{head}{tail}</code>: the
concatenation of <code >{head}</code> and <code >{tail}</code>. 
<p>
Lookahead tail patterns, however, must match input strings which should be as
short as possible. To find this shortest tail pattern the scanner tries to
match the last character of the text that matched <code >{head}/{tail}</code> with the
<code >{tail}</code> pattern. If this succeeds, then the shortest tail was found. If the
last character didn't already match <code >{tail}</code> then the last two characters
are matched against <code >{tail}</code>. This process (i.e., increasing the length of
the final substring of the input matching <code >{head}{tail}</code>) is continued until
<code >{tail}</code> is eventually matched. This must succeed since, after all, the full
input matched <code >{head}{tail}</code>. Thus a short tail was found matching
<code >{tail}</code>.
<p>
After matching the tail pattern, the matching final substring is removed from
the original input string, and the initial substring is passed to the
<code >{head}</code> pattern, thus finding the <em >longest</em> match, given that the
remaining characters of the matched text still match <code >{tail}</code>. Figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#LOPPROCEDURE">11</a> illustrates the algorithm.
<p>
<p><a name="LOPPROCEDURE"></a><figure >
<img src="images/lopprocedure.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 11: Look-ahead matching algorithm</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Some minor optimizations handle potentially zero length tails and handle fixed
tail lengths. With potentially zero length tail lengths (e.g.,
<code >{head}/{tail}*</code>) the scanner ignores the tail and replaces
<code >{head}/{tail}*</code>) by <code >{head}</code>). With fixed tail lengths the length of the
tail (<code >|tail|</code> is known, and the final <code >|tail|</code> characters of the matched
input text can immediately be pushed back on to the input stream, returning
the remaining text as the text matching <code >{head}</code>.
<p>
The following subsections describe how <strong >flexc++</strong> recognizes and handles
LOP-patterns. The next section (<a href="flexc++06.html#LOPRUNTIME">6.18</a>) describes the run-time
handling of LOP-patterns.
<p>
<a name="l49"></a>
<h3 >6.10.1: The parser recognizing LOP patterns</h3>
        Regular expressions are parsed according to the rules in
<code >parser/inc/regexoreof</code>. LOP-patterns are recognized using
        <pre>

    _regex '/' _regex
    {
        $$ = lookahead($1, $3);
    }
        
</pre>

    Here <code >_regex</code> represents a regular expression pattern, stored in 
<code >Pattern</code> objects.
<p>
The parser's member <code >lookahead</code> verifies that a regular expression contains
but one LOP, and that the LOP is not used in a parenthesized regular
expression. If the rhs pattern can be empty the rhs is ignored and the lhs
pattern is returned. If the rhs pattern has a fixed non-zero length the
<code >Pattern</code> constructor 
        <pre>

    Pattern(States &amp;states, size_t tailLength,
            Pattern const &amp;lhs, Pattern const &amp;rhs);    
        
</pre>

    is called to define a pattern having a fixed length tail. Otherwise a
variable (standard) LOP-expression was encountered. 
<p>
Standard <code >LOP</code> expressions are handled according to the algorithm
illustrated in figure <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPPROCEDURE">11</a>. This is implemented using two
separate startconditions (see the next section (<a href="flexc++06.html#LOPSCs">6.10.1.1</a>)).
<p>
Until the tail pattern is actually matched, its length is gradually
increased. This is handled by a catch-all rule (using the pattern <code >.|\n</code>)
which can be added to the scanner's input, and which is used as fall-back rule
in tail-matching start conditions (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPSCs">6.10.1.1</a>).
<p>
<a name="LOPSCs"></a><a name="l50"></a>
<h4 >6.10.1.1: Start conditions used by standard 
                                LOP patterns</h4>
            Standard LOP-patterns are handled through start conditions which are only
referable by code generated by <strong >flexc++</strong> itself. Each regular (standard LOP)
expression of the form
        <pre>

    {head}/{tail}       action-block
        
</pre>

    results in two additional start conditions <code >x</code> and <code >x+1</code>, which are
defined only for handling this LOP-pattern. <strong >Flexc++</strong> generates code in which the
above regular expression is transformed into rules that would have looked like
this in a <strong >flexc++</strong> specification file:
        <pre>

    {head}{tail}       lop1_(x);

    &lt;x&gt;{
        {tail}          lop2_();
        .|\n            lop3_();
    }

    &lt;x+1&gt;{head}         {
                            lop4_();
                            action-block
                        }
        
</pre>

    Once <code >{head}{tail}</code> is matched (see also figure <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPPROCEDURE">11</a>), an
internally defined member <code >lop1_(x)</code> is called. This function prepares the
scanner for matching the LOP-expression (cf. section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPRUNTIME">6.18</a>), and
switches to start condition <code >x</code>.
<p>
In start condition <code >x</code>, an attempt is made to match <code >{tail}</code>. If this
does <em >not</em> succeed, the catch-all rule is matched, and <code >lop3_()</code>
pushes two characters back on to the input stream: the character preceding the
currently first character of the tail and the just-matched character. Thus the
input now contains an incremented potential tail, and the scanner again tries
to match <code >{tail}</code>. This eventually succeeds, and <code >lop2_()</code> is called. 
<p>
The member <code >lop2_()</code> pushes all characters initially matched for
<code >{head}{tail}</code>, except for the final <code >|tail|</code> number of characters, on to
the input stream, and switches to start condition <code >x+1</code>.
<p>
At start condition <code >x+1</code> <code >lop4_()</code> is called, which pushes the characters
of the originally matched input <em >beyond</em> the currently matched input
characters back on the input stream. This returns the tail beyond the string
matched for <code >{head}</code> on to the input. Next it resets the scanner to the
start condition that was active when <code >{head}{tail}</code> was first
matched. Finally the original action-block's statements (if any) are executed.
<p>
Fixed length LOP-expressions do not need additional start conditions, nor do
they need catch-all rules. When the above LOP-expression uses a 
fixed-length tail <code >t</code>, it is transformed to
        <pre>

    {head}{tail}        {
                            lopf_(t);
                            action-block
                        }
        
</pre>

    The member <code >lopf_(t)</code> simply pushed the final <code >t</code> characters of the
matched input back on to the input stream, resizing <code >d_matched</code> to
<code >d_matched.length() - t</code>. 
<p>
<a name="LOPPATTERN"></a><a name="l51"></a>
<h3 >6.10.2: Pattern constructors used with LOP patterns</h3>
        Two <code >Pattern</code> constructors are used to handle LOP-expressions (see also
figure <a href="flexc++06.html#PATTERN">8</a>, showing the data-members of <code >Pattern</code>
objects). <code >Pattern</code> constructors that are used to represent LOP-patterns use
their <code >d_lopData</code> members. If this member is zero, the object does not
represent a LOP-pattern; if it is non-zero it points to a <code >LopData</code> struct,
and the object <em >does</em> represent a LOP-pattern. 
<p>
This is the constructor used to represent a LOP expression having a fixed
non-zero length LOP-tail:
        <pre>

    Pattern(States &amp;states, size_t tailLength,
            Pattern const &amp;lhs, Pattern const &amp;rhs);    
        
</pre>

    In this case the <code >LopData's</code> <code >mid</code> and <code >lhs</code> fields are not used,
and <code >scOrLength</code> stores the length of the fixed-length tail of the
LOP-expression. 
<p>
As the pattern to match is <code >{head}{tail}</code>, the states of the <code >lhs</code> and
<code >rhs</code> expressions are concatenated, and the concatenated states are accessed
though the object's <code >d_pair</code> member.
<p>
<p><a name="LOPDATA"></a><figure >
<img src="images/lopdata.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 12: Pattern data organization for LOP-expressions</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
For standard LOP-expressions (having variable length tails) the next
constructor is used (cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPDATA">12</a>):
        <pre>

    Pattern(States &amp;states,
            Pattern const &amp;lhs, Pattern const &amp;rhs,     
            size_t lopStartCondition);    
        
</pre>

    Here the pattern to match is, as before, the concatenated states of the
lhs and rhs patterns, which are accessed though the object's <code >d_pair</code>
member. 
<p>
Once <code >{head}{tail}</code> has been matched, the tail pattern must
be matched, using a separate start condition. The state number of the
<code >{tail}</code> pattern's first state is stored in <code >d_lopData-&gt;mid</code>, and is
used later (by the <code >Rules</code> object) to create a specific tail-matching
rule. 
<p>
The (number of the) start condition handling the tail-matching process is
<code >lopStartCondition</code> which is stored in <code >d_lopData-&gt;scOrLength</code>. 
<p>
Another rule must be available to match <code >{head}</code>, once <code >{tail}</code> has been
matched. The states of this rule are accessed through <code >d_lopData-&gt;lhs</code>,
which is a <code >Pattern</code> object initialized with the states of a duplicate of
the lhs pattern. Once the <code >{tail}</code> has been matched, this duplicated pattern
is used to match <code >{head}</code> in the next start condition.
<p>
The <em >type</em> of a pattern is inferred from the pattern object's <code >d_lopData</code>
member. If zero, then the pattern does not represent a LOP-expression, and its
type (returned by its <code >type()</code> member) is <code >RuleType::NORMAL</code>. Otherwise,
if the LOP-expression has a fixed-size tail, then <code >d_lopData-&gt;mid</code> equals 0,
and the pattern's type is <code >RuleType::LOP_FIXED</code>. If <code >d_lopData-&gt;mid</code> is
unequal 0, then the pattern represent a standard LOP-expression, and its type
is <code >RuleType::LOP_1</code>. 
<p>
<a name="l52"></a>
<h3 >6.10.3: Adding (LOP-)rules</h3>
        Once <code >parser/inc/regexoreof</code> has recognized a pattern (whether or not a
LOP-expression) it is further processed by either <code >optMs_rule</code> (optional
start condition rule) in <code >parser/inc/optmsrule</code>, or by <code >msCompound</code> (mini
scanner compound) in <code >parser/inc/mscompound</code>. 
<p>
In both cases the actions that are associated with the regular expressions are
determined (they may be `or-actions', in which case the action consists of a
<code >|</code>-character, indicating that this rule uses the same action as the next
rule, or no actions may be defined, representing an empty action block).
<p>
Having determined a pattern and action block, the combination of pattern,
action, possibly a begin-of-line requirement (i.e., a rule starting with
<code >^</code>), and the pattern's type are passed to <code >d_rules.add</code>, adding another
rule to the set of available rules.
<p>
Adding a rule (cf. <code >rules/add.cc</code>) means:
    <ul>
    <li> Add the rule's information to the <code >Rules</code> object's <code >d_rules</code>
        vector of rules;
    <li> associate its end-state with its index in <code >d_rules</code>, so the DFA 
        construction knows which rule is matched when this state is
        reached. This rule-index is used as a case label in the scanner's
        <code >executeAction_</code> member;
    <li> calling <code >setRule(pair.first, ruleIdx)</code> to associate the rule's
        states with the rule's index;
    <li> adding the rule index to the currently active set of start
        conditions.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l53"></a>
<h3 >6.10.4: After parsing: adding LOP start conditions</h3>
        After parsing <code >Parser::addLopStartConditions</code> is called.
<p>
If no variable tail LOP rules were encountered, this function immediately
returns. Otherwise, there are tail matching start conditions, which
need a catch-all rule, and for each variable tail LOP rule two start
conditions are defined. 
<p>
The catch-all rule is added to the <code >Rules</code> object by the
<code >Rules::processCatchAllRule</code> member. The catch-all rule is the last rule,
injected by the scanner once it has reached the end of its input. It is stored
inside the <code >Rules</code> object in a separate <code >Rule d_catchAll</code> object.
<p>
Next the variable tail LOP rules' start conditions are defined.  At this point
all user-defined rules are known, and the user-defined start conditions are
also known (as the parser has processed the <code >%x</code> and <code >%s</code>
directives). Therefore, all start conditions which are required for handling
standard LOP-rules have index values exceeding the number of user-defined
start conditions. When a standard LOP-rule was encountered by the parser,
<code >Parser::lookahead</code> increased its <code >d_lopStartCondition</code> by 2, and so at
this point <code >d_lopStartConditions - d_rules.size()</code> start conditions are
defined.
<p>
These start conditions are for internal use only. Their names are not made
available in the generated <code >ScannerBase.h</code> header file. They start with a
blank space, which can therefore not be specified in user-defined input
files. Furthermore, the code generator only adds the user-defined start
condition names to the <code >enum class StartCondition_</code>, defined in
<code >ScannerBase.h</code>, so the variable tail LOP rules' start conditions cannot be
specified by user-called <code >begin</code> statements.
<p>
<a name="l54"></a>
<h3 >6.10.5: After parsing: handling LOP rules</h3>
        The function <code >Rules::handleLopRules</code> performs rule-finalization.
<p>
Once the parser has completed its work, the <code >Rules</code> object finalizes its
rules, adding additional rules for <code >LOP_1</code> type of rules. 
<p>
First <code >Rules::setLopBlocks</code> ensures that each variable length LOP rule has
its own action block. The variable tail length LOP rules receive their own
<code >lop1_(size_t sc)</code> action block, but their original action blocks must
remain available, to be added eventually to the <code >lop4_()</code> action, after
matching the LOP rule's <code >{head}</code> pattern. Comparable considerations hold
true for fixed-sized tail length LOP rules. Here the rule's original action is
appended to the rule's <code >lopf_(size_t tailLength)</code> call.
<p>
To prepare the rules for their appropriate actions, consider figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#LOPRULES">13</a>. 
<p>
<p><a name="LOPRULES"></a><figure >
<img src="images/setlopblocks.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 13: Providing rules with action blocks</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Initially, <code >actionIdx</code> and <code >lopIdx</code> point beyond the last rule index. When
a rule has an action block of its own <code >actionIdx</code> is given this rule's index
value: <code >actionIdx</code> always holds the index of the most recent rule having an
action block of its own. Likewise, <code >lopIdx</code> always holds the index of the
most recent LOP rule. 
<p>
If a LOP rule has an or-action, then it receives a copy of the most recently
seen action block. If a normal rule has an or-action then it receives a copy
of the most recently seen action block <em >if</em> this happens to be a LOP rule's
own action block.
<p>
After <code >setLopBlock</code> all LOP rules have their own true (i.e., not or-actions)
action blocks.
<p>
Next, all fixed tail length LOP rules are processed: each fixed tail length
LOP rule's action block receives an initial <code >lopf_(tailSize);</code> statement,
where <code >tailSize</code> is obtained from the rule's <code >pattern.lopTailLength()</code>
member.
<p>
If there are variable tail length LOP rules then these are processed next (by
<code >Rules::handleLopRule(idx)</code>). 
<p>
<code >Rules::handleLopRule</code> receives the index of a variable tail length LOP
rule and changes its action block to <code >lop1_(scIndex)</code>, where <code >scIndex</code> is
the start condition index matching this LOP rule's tail. <code >ScIndex</code> is
obtained from the rule's <code >pattern-&gt;scIndex()</code> member. 
<p>
Next, the lop rule's start condition is activated at <code >d_startConditions</code> and
the LOP rule's <code >{tail}</code> pattern is added to this start condition, using
<code >RuleType::LOP_2</code>. This start condition also needs a catch-all rule, using
action block <code >lop3_()</code>, but as all variable tail length LOP rules share
this catch-all rule, they are handled separately, see below.
<p>
Finally, the lop rule's 2nd start condition is activated and
the LOP rule's <code >{head}</code> pattern is added to this start condition, using
<code >RuleType::LOP_4</code>, prefixing the original rule's action block by the
statement <code >lop4_()</code> (see also section <a href="flexc++06.html#LOPSCs">6.10.1.1</a>).
<p>
Once all variable tail length LOP rules have been processed the catch-all rule
is added to the <code >Rules</code> object, using <code >RuleType::LOP_3</code>, and the catch-all
rule is added to each second start condition of each variable tail length LOP
rule (by <code >Rules::addCatchAll</code>).

<h2 >6.11: Ranges</h2>
    When processing characters in regular expressions subranges are defined. An
expression like `<code >am</code>' defines the ranges ascii-0 to (but not including)
<code >'a'</code>; <code >'a'</code>; <code >'b'</code> through <code >'l'</code>; <code >'m'</code>; and <code >'n'</code> through
ascii-255. 
<p>
Likewise, sets may define ranges, like <code >[[:digits:]]</code>, defining all
ascii characters preceding the digits; all decimal digits; and all ascii
characters following the digits. 
<p>
Rather than having a NFA/DFA having entries for each of these characters the
NFA/DFA's column-dimension (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFA">6.13</a>) can be reduced, often
considerably, by letting each column refer to a <em >set</em> of characters, rather
than individual characters. 
<p>
The <code >Ranges</code> object takes care of defining and manipulating the actual 
subsets. Its data organization is given in figure <a href="flexc++06.html#RANGESFIG">14</a>.
<p>
<p><a name="RANGESFIG"></a><figure >
<img src="images/ranges.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 14: The class Ranges data members</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Initially <code >d_ranges</code> is filled with all zeroes. Once a range of characters
or a single character is defined in a pattern, it is added to the <code >Ranges</code>
object (functions <code >add</code> accepting single characters or strings). The
occurrence counts of the added characters are incremented if necessary. De
functions <code >update</code>, <code >collision</code>, and <code >countRanges</code> handle the updating.
<p>
Details of the algorithm are not covered here, until the need for this arises.
For the time being consult the sources for details. 
<p>
In the user interface the important members are <code >rangeOf, rangeOfBOL</code> and
<code >rangeofEOF</code>, returning the column indices in DFAs to which input characters
belong. 
<p>
<a name="l56"></a>
<h2 >6.12: The class DFAs</h2>
    The regular expression patterns define non-finite state automata (NFA) which
must be converted to deterministic finite state automata (DFA). Each mini
scanner has its own DFA and the class <code >DFAs</code> builds the various DFAs for
each of the start conditions. The DFA construction needs access to the rules,
states and character ranges, which are available to the <code >DFAs</code> object)
(cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#DFASFIG">15</a>)
<p>
<p><a name="DFASFIG"></a><figure >
<img src="images/dfas.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 15: The DFAs class organization</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
The <code >DFAs</code> object's real work is performed by its <code >build</code> member. The
<code >build</code> member visits all the elements of <code >Rules</code>, passing each of the
start conditions (stored in the <code >Rules</code> object) to <code >buildDFA</code>. For each of
the start conditions, holding the indices of the rules that are defined for
the various start conditions, a DFA is constructed for all of the rules of
that start condition (cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#STARTCOND">6.3</a>).
<p>
The function <code >buildDFA</code> performs two tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> It adds another element to its <code >d_dfa</code> vector. Each element of
<code >d_dfa</code>  contains
        <ul>
            <li> the name of the start condition (obtained from the <code >Rules</code>'s
                <code >NameVector</code>), and 
            <li> an initialized <code >DFA</code> object (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFA">6.13</a>)
        </ul>
    <li> Next it calls the <code >DFA</code> function <code >build</code> for the just initialized
<code >DFA</code>, passing it the vector of indices of the start states for that mini
scanner. <code >Build</code> constructs the start condition's DFA, see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFA">6.13</a>.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="DFA"></a><a name="l57"></a>
<h2 >6.13: The DFA</h2>
    The conversion from NFA to DFA is the job of the class <code >DFA</code> object
(cf. figure <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAFIG">16</a>)
<p>
<p><a name="DFAFIG"></a><figure >
<img src="images/dfa.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 16: The DFA class data members</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
The DFA uses the externally available rules, states and character ranges
and builds a vector of <code >DFARow</code>s, named <code >d_row</code>. It has the following data
members:
    <ul>
    <li><code >d_row</code>: the vector of <code >DFARow</code> objects, defining the rows of the DFA
(cf. section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAROW">6.14</a>);
    <li><code >d_stateSet</code>: a vector of sets of <code >State</code> indices. There are as many
sets in this vector as there are elements in <code >d_row</code>, and each element holds
the indices of the <code >State</code> objects in <code >d_states</code> that are represented by
the matching <code >DFARow</code> object.
    <li><code >d_verbose</code>: shadows the presence of the <code >--verbose</code> program flag.
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l58"></a>
<h3 >6.13.1: DFA::build: From NFA to DFA</h3>
        Building the DFA from the NFA is the task of <code >DFA::build</code>. 
<p>
Each row of <code >d_row</code> defines a state in the DFA. The Rule numbers of the
Rules defining a start condition received as <code >build</code>'s <code >vector&lt;size_t&gt;</code>
parameter. 
<p>
<code >DFA::build</code> initially stores the start states of the rules of its start
condition in its <code >d_stateSet[0]</code><sup >th</sup> element, which is a set (cf. figure
<a href="flexc++06.html#DFAFIG1">17</a>). This is done by <code >DFA::fillStartSet</code>
<p>
<p><a name="DFAFIG1"></a><figure >
<img src="images/dfa1.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 17: Creating the start states for row 0</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
Next, the e-closure of this initial set of states is computed. The e-closure
algorithm is described in ASU's dragon book (1986, figure 3.26). It
essentially adds all states that can be reached from each element in the
current set of states on an empty transition. The e-closure is computed by
<code >States::eClosure</code>.
<p>
At this point there is an element in <code >DFA::d_stateSet</code>, but not yet an
element in <code >DFA::d_row</code>. By adding a <code >DFARow</code> (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAROW">6.14</a>) to
<code >d_row</code> we associate a <code >DFARow</code> with an initial set of states. 
<p>
Once the new DFA has been added to <code >d_row</code> its transitions are probed by
<code >DFARow::transitions</code> (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAROW">6.14</a>).
<p>
<a name="l59"></a>
<h3 >6.13.2: Removing duplicate rows</h3>
            Having determined the transitions <code >build</code> proceeds to remove
implied/identical rows, calling <code >DFA::keepUniqueRows</code>. This latter function
visits each of the rows of the DFA, testing whether an existing row has the
same transitions and final state information as the current row. `Same
transitions' means that the transitions of the current (under inspection) row
are present in an earlier row; `same final state information' means that the
current row is a final state for the same rule(s) as an earlier row. In such
situations the current row can be merged with the earlier row, keeping the
earlier row. The (later) row can then be removed as transitions from it are
identical to those from the earlier row. This may happen, as the NFA
construction algorithm may define more empty edges than strictly necessary,
sometimes resulting in additional rows in the DFAs. As an example, consider
the pattern <code >(a|ab)+/(a|ba)+</code>, producing the DFA

    Rows 6 and 7 are identical, as are rows 2 and 4. For row 4 the (erroneous,
if |TAIL| should be as short as possible) |TAIL| = 2 is shown, resulting from
<code >aba</code> being interpreted as HEAD: <code >a</code> and TAIL: <code >ba</code>. 
<p>
But when |TAIL| should be minimized <code >aba</code> should be interpreted as HEAD:
<code >ab</code> and TAIL <code >a</code>, resulting in transitions 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2, with |TAIL|
= 1. This happens when row 4 is merged to row 2. Having merged the rows,
former transitions to the now removed rows must of course be updated to the
merging row. So row 3 must transit to 2 when receiving input symbol <code >a</code>. The
member <code >shrinkDFA</code> handles the shrinkage of the DFA. In this example the
final DFA becomes:

<h2 >6.14: The rows of the DFA: DFAROW</h2>
    Rows of DFA matrices relate (ranges of) input characters to rows (states) to
transit to (see figure <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAROWFIG">18</a>). 
<p>
<p><a name="DFAROWFIG"></a><figure >
<img src="images/dfarow.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 18: The data of the class DFARow</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
A <code >DFARow</code> row specification is defined by a set of states
accessible as <code >d_stateSets[d_thisIdx]</code>. The values of this set define the
(e-closure of the) states of this row (see section <a href="flexc++06.html#DFA">6.13</a>).
<p>
Each of these states may result in a transition to another state when
observing a character from one of the DFA's input ranges. These `states to
transit to' in turn define another set of states (possibly identical to the
set of states defining the current row).
<p>
Transitions from this row are probed for each of the character ranges (in
<code >Ranges</code>, see <a href="flexc++06.html#RANGES">6.11</a>) by <code >DFARow::transitions</code>. The member
<code >DFARow::transitions</code> may add new elements to <code >d_stateSet</code>, continuing the
iteration until eventually there are as many <code >d_row</code> elements as there are
<code >d_transitions</code> elements.
<p>
If this set of states to transit to is not yet present in the <code >DFA</code> then a
new row is added to the DFA. Adding rows is the task of <code >DFA::build</code>,
defining and adding new sets of <code >State</code>s is the responsibility of
<code >DFARow::transition</code>.
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code >d_map</code>: the <code >DFARow</code>'s <code >unordered_map d_map</code> defines the
relationship between an input character range (the map's key) and the row to
transit to when a character from that input range has been observed.
    <li><code >d_finalRule</code>: the elements of the pair <code >d_finalRule</code> are indices of
rules in <code >Rules</code> for which this <code >DFARow</code> represents a final state. The
<em >first</em> element of the pair refers to a rule whose RE not necessarily starts
at BOL, the <em >second</em> element refers to a rule whose RE must start at
BOL. When a value equals <code >UINT_MAX</code> then the current row is not a final
state for such a rule.
    <li><code >d_thisIdx</code>: the index of the current <code >DFARow</code> element in its <code >DFA</code>
matrix.
    <li><code >d_stateSets</code>: this data member is a pointer to a vector containing
sets of states represented by the rows of the DFA. Element
<code >d_stateSets[d_thisIdx]</code> is the set of states represented by the current DFA
row. 
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l61"></a>
<h3 >6.14.1: Associating a DFARow with a Rule</h3>
        The values in <code >d_final</code> are set by <code >setFinal</code>, called from
<code >DFARow::transit</code>. It receives the  the rule index
given the index of the row's <code >State</code>. 
<p>
If the rule index refers to a BOL rule <code >d_finalRule.second</code> is inspected,
otherwise <code >d_finalRule.first</code> is inspected.
<p>
If the inspected value doesn't refer to a rule yet, the current rule index is
assigned. Otherwise, if the current rule type (NORMAL or LOP-rule)
equals the rule index's type, and the rule index is smaller than the
inspected element's value, or if the rule index refers to a NORMAL rule, but
the inspected element doesn't, then the rule index is assigned to the
inspected element.
<p>
Thus a DFA row will always be associated with the first rule that reaches its
final state at the current DFA row if both rules are of identical types, and
it will be associated with the NORMAL rule if the other rule is not a NORMAL
rule. 
<p>
<a name="VIABLE"></a><a name="l62"></a>
<h2 >6.15: Finding non-viable rules</h2>
    The following procedure determines which rules can be matched (are viable) and
which rules aren't:
<p>
<ul>
    <li> From <code >DFA::build</code> transitions are determined for each new row;
    <li> Transitions are determined by <code >DFARow::transitions</code>;
    <li> From <code >DFARow::transitions</code> <code >DFARow::transit</code> transitions on the
        current input character are determined
    <li> At <code >DFARow::transit</code>, if the current state is a <code >FINAL</code> state,
        the rule that is matched is determined by <code >DFARow::setFinal</code>
    </ul>
<p>
Each <code >DFARow</code> has a <code >std::pair&lt;size_t, size_t&gt; d_finalRule</code> data
member. In <code >setFinal</code> a rule index is received. If the matching rule is a
BOL-rule then <code >d_finalRule.second</code> is determined, otherwise
<code >d_finalRule.first</code>.
<p>
When multiple rules could match at a final state, then the rule mentioned
first takes precedence. Since the elements of <code >d_finalRule</code> are initialized
at <code >max&lt;size_t&gt;()</code>, the received rule index is assigned to the appropriate
<code >d_finalRule</code> field if it's smaller than the currently stored value.
<p>
Once the DFAs have been constructed, the viability of the rules is determined
by <code >DFAs::warnNonViable</code>. This function is called from <code >main</code>.
<p>
<code >DFAs::warnNonViable</code> first defines the set of all user-defined rule
indices. Next it visits all DFAs not having numeric names (as these are
internally defined DFAs added by the DFA construction process for LOP-rules),
removing all rules that can be matched at their DFA rows from the set of rule
indices. If any indices remain in this set then these rules cannot be matched,
and a warning is issued for each of them.
<p>
Be cautious when defining LOP patterns allowing empty head-matches. The
following series of rules result in rule 2 never being matched: an <code >ab</code>
sequence matches the tail of rule 1, with an empty head. Next, <code >ab</code> is
re-scanned and the procedure repeats itself:
        <pre>

    [[:blank:]]+
    a*/a*b              d_p = "a*/a*b"; return 1;
    ab                  d_p = "ab";     return 2;
    .                   d_p = ".";      return 3;
        
</pre>

    The repair consists of reordering these rules, or disallowing an empty
LOP-head. Reordering the rules solves the problem:
        <pre>

    [[:blank:]]+
    ab                  d_p = "ab";     return 1;
    .                   d_p = ".";      return 2;
    a*/a*b              d_p = "a*/a*b"; return 3;
        
</pre>

    Now rule 1 takes priority over rule 3: an <code >ab</code> sequence is matched by
rule 1, rather than becoming rule 3's tail.
<p>
Likewise, with the following set of rules rule 2 will never match, as the LOP
rule recognizes the <code >\n</code> (realize that <code >$</code> means: <code >/\n</code>):
        <pre>

    //%nowarn
    .*$         d_p = ".*$"; return 1;
    \n
        
</pre>

    Again, reordering (or using a non-empty LOP head) solves the
problem. E.g., using reordering:
        <pre>

    \n
    //%nowarn
    .*$         d_p = ".*$"; return 1;
        
</pre>

<p>
<a name="l63"></a>
<h2 >6.16: Generating Code</h2>
    Code is generated by an object of the class <code >Generator</code>.  The generator
generates the following files (using default names, all defaults can be
overruled by directives and options):
<p>
<ul>
<li><code >Scannerbase.h.</code> This file defines the scanner's base class. It is always
rewritten and declares data members used by the scanner.
<p>
<li><code >Scanner.h.</code> This file represents the generated scanner's interface. It
inherits from <code >ScannerBase</code> and is written only if not existing. 
<p>
<li><code >Scanner.ih.</code> This file represents the generated scanner's <em >internal
header file</em>. The internal header file is part of a design philosophy
according to which all source files belonging to a class should merely include
the internal header file, which declares all headers and other elements that
are required for the correct compilation of the class's source files.
<p>
<li><code >lex.cc</code> This file contains the implementation of the scanner function and
any support functions it may need. This file is always rewritten.
</ul>
<p>
Each of these files has a skeleton, found in <code >/usr/share/flexc++</code> (the
development header files are in the <code >skeletons/</code> subdirectory of the source
package). The skeletons are the templates (molds) from which the files
matching the requirements as defined in <strong >flexc++</strong>'s input <strong >s</strong> are created:
    <ul> 
    <li> <em >Static data</em> are inserted into the generated <code >lex.cc</code> file;
    <li> <em >Actions</em> are inserted into the generated <code >lex.cc</code>;
    <li> <em >Declarations</em> are inserted into the generated <code >Scannerbase.h</code>
        file. 
    </ul>
    The member <code >genLex</code> generates the lexer file <code >lex.cc</code>. It recognizes
<code >$insert</code> lines starting in column 1 and performs the matching action,
inserting appropriate elements into the generated file.
<p>
Other generating members act similarly:
<p>
The member <code >genBase</code> generates the scanner base file <code >Scannerbase.h</code>, the
member <code >genScanner</code> generates <code >Scanner.h</code>.
<p>
The code generated by <code >flexc++</code> must read input, match the input with some
regular expressin and return the associated token. A catch-all escape is
provided by the implicitly provided rule echoing all non-matched input to the
standard output stream.
<p>
The generated code consists of these parts:
    <ul>
    <li> The character-table (actually: range-table). See section
        <a href="flexc++06.html#RANGETAB">6.16.1</a>. 
<p>
<li> The DFAs are generated by <code >Generator::dfas</code>. 
    </ul>
<p>
For each of the DFAs the function <code >Generator::dfa</code> is called. 
<p>
The function <code >Generator::dfa</code> receives as its first argument a
<code >DFAs::Pair</code> (see figure <a href="flexc++06.html#DFASFIG">15</a>), containing the name of the
start condition that is associated with the DFA and the DFA itself.
The function performs the following tasks:
    <ul>
    <li> The name of the current start condition is stored in
        <code >startStates</code> (to allow checking for repetitive handling);
    <li> The row number of the first row of the current DFA in <code >s_dfa</code>
        is saved in the vector <code >dfaOffsets</code>;
    <li> <code >Generator::dfaRow</code> is called for each row of the DFA (see figure
        <a href="flexc++06.html#DFAROWFIG">18</a>). This latter function writes the vector of DFA rows to
        transit to (i.e., rows relative to the current DFA's start row, so not
        the actual rows in <code >s_dfa</code>) for each of the character ranges
        (calling <code >Generator::dfaTransitions</code>), followed by the number of the
        rule that is matched if the rule represents a final state not
        necessarily at BOL and the number of the rule that is matched if the
        rule represents a final state at BOL. Values -1 are used if no such
        rules exist for the state represented by the current row.  
    </ul>
<p>
The function <code >Generator::declarations</code> adds the declarations of
<code >(*d_dfaBase_)[], s_dfa_[][], s_dfaBase_[][]</code> etc. to <code >ScannerBase.h</code>,
providing these declarations with their required (higher order) dimension
values. 
<p>
The function <code >Generator::actions</code> inserts the actions in the function
<code >ScannerBase::executeAction_</code>, implemented in <code >lex.cc</code>. Actions are
inserted separately for each <code >RuleType</code> that was used. Each <code >NORMAL,
LOP_1, LOP_4</code> and <code >LOP_FIXED</code> (fixed-tail LOP rule) type of rule has its own
action block, and their action blocks are inserted first. <code >LOP_2</code> and
<code >LOP_3</code> actions are all identical, and <strong >flexc++</strong> creates a set of fall-through
case labels for these actions. 
<p>
<a name="RANGETAB"></a><a name="l64"></a>
<h3 >6.16.1: The range-table</h3>
            The character-table translates input characters into ranges.  Each input
character (by default the 256 extended ascii-characters) is associated with a
character <em >range</em>. Character <em >range</em> indices are then used as column
indices of the DFA tables (see sections <a href="flexc++06.html#RANGES">6.11</a> and <a href="flexc++06.html#DFA">6.13</a>).
<p>
The function <code >Generator::charTable</code> defines in <code >d_out</code> the static
data member <code >size_t const ScannerBase::s_ranges[]</code>. This array has 256
elements, so each character (cast to type <code >unsigned char</code>) can be used as
an index into this array, returning its range-number.
<p>
In addition to real input characters, the scanner may return two pseudo
range values: <code >rangeOfBOL</code> is the range matching the special `character'
<code >BOL</code>, returned when a begin-of-line is sensed, and <code >rangeOfEOF</code> which is
returned when EOF was sensed (e.g., when the <code >&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt;</code> rule was used).
These BOL and EOF tokens must be returned by <code >nextChar</code> when BOL or EOF was
sensed, and the DFA's recognizes their ranges. The ranges <code >rangeEOF</code> and
<code >rangeBOL</code> are declared in the scanner class's data members section.
<p>
If DFA's don't recognize BOL or EOF characters then the default action is
performed: BOL is ignored and EOF results in switching back to the previous
stream or in returning token 0 (and ending the scanning-process).
<p>
The code generator adds code handing BOL and EOF to scanners using these
pseudo characters. The code is left out of the generated scanner if these
pseudo characters are not used.
<p>
Range tables are generated by <code >generator/chartable.cc</code>.

<h3 >6.16.2: The DFAs</h3>
        The function <code >Generator::dfas</code>, defined in <code >generator/dfas</code> defines
defines in <code >d_out</code> the static data member <code >int const
ScannerBase::s_dfa[][dfaCols()]</code>, where <code >dfaCols</code> returns the number of
columns of the DFA matrices.
<p>
<em >All</em> DFAs are accessed through this single <code >s_dfa</code> matrix. Each
individual DFA starts at a specific row of <code >s_dfa</code>. The first DFA to be
written is associated with the <code >INITIAL</code> scanner: <code >INITIAL</code> is always
defined and contains all rules not explicitly associated with a start condition.
<p>
The matrix <code >s_dfa</code> contains the rows of <em >all</em> DFAs, including those that
were generated by <strong >flexc++</strong> itself, with the start state <code >INITIAL</code> always
being the first DFA.
<p>
Each row contains the row to transit to if the column's character range was
sensed. Row numbers are relative to the used DFA. There are as many elements
in the rows of the <code >s_dfa</code> table as there are character ranges <em >plus</em>
two. These final elements represent rule indices of, respectively, the matched
rule (normal case) and the matched rule in case of BOL. The value -1 is used
if no such rule is associated with the DFA row.
<p>
The <em >base locations</em> for the various start conditions are defined in the
static array <code >s_dfaBase</code>. Its initial value matches the <code >INITIAL</code> scanner,
and points to the first <code >s_dfa</code> row. Additional values are defined for each
additional start condition, and point to the initial rows in <code >s_dfa</code> for
these start conditions. Here is an example of a <code >enum class Begin</code> and
matching <code >s_dfaBase</code>:
        <pre>

    enum class Begin
    {
        INITIAL,
        str,
    };
        
    std::vector&lt;int const (*)[9]&gt; const ScannerBase::s_dfaBase =
    {
        { s_dfa + 0 },
        { s_dfa + 6 },
    };
        
</pre>

    The <code >INITIAL</code> scanner's dfa rows start at the top, the <code >str</code> mini
scanner starts at row index 6 of <code >s_dfa</code>.
<p>
<a name="RUNTIME"></a><a name="l66"></a>
<h2 >6.17: Run-time operations</h2>
    The <code >lex</code> function works as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> All its variables have been initialized at construction time. In
    particular, initially the run-time variable <code >d_atBOL</code> is set to
    <code >true</code>. 
<li> In a loop (until EOF) characters are retrieved until a rule is matched
    (see below)
<li> Once a rule has been matched its matching code block is executed.
</ul>
<p>
Characters from the input are assigned to <code >d_char</code>. At the beginning of the
character processing loop <code >d_char</code> already has received a value.  At EOF the
character is given the (pseudo) character value <code >AT_EOF</code>. 
<p>
Next, the character's range (<code >d_range</code>) is determined from
<code >s_ranges[d_char]</code>.
<p>
The variable <code >d_dfaBase</code> points at the dfa currently used. The variable
<code >d_dfaIdx</code> holds the index of the current row in the current dfa. 
<p>
The expression 
        <pre>

    nextIdx = (d_dfa + d_dfaIdx)[d_range];
        
</pre>
 
    provides the next <code >d_dfaIdx</code> value. If unequal -1 do:
        <pre>

    d_dfaIdx = nextIdx;
    d_char = nextChar();
        
</pre>

    If equal -1 then there is no continuation for the current rule. 
<p>
Depending on the current state and action several action types can be returned
by the run-time function <code >actionType_</code>:
    <ul>
    <li><code >CONTINUE</code>: there exists a continuation from the current state/range
            combination; 
    <li><code >MATCH</code>: a final state has been reached and there's no continuation
            possible. In this case a rule has been matched
    <li><code >ECHO1ST</code>: no continuation is possible for the current range, and no
            final state was reached, the input buffer contains one or more
            characters.
    <li><code >ECHOCHAR</code>: no continuation is possible for the current range, no
            final state was reached and the input buffer is still empty
    <li><code >RETURN</code>: input exhausted, <code >lex</code> returns 0.
    </ul>
<p>
The following table shows how actions are determined by <code >actionType_</code>. The
function <code >actionType_</code> starts it tests at the first row of the table, and
stops as soon as a condition hold true, returning the action type:
    <div style="text-align: center">
    <table>

</table></div>
<p>
For each of the returned action types actions must be performed:
<p>
<ul>
    <li><code >CONTINUE:</code> store the input character (not being <code >AT_EOF</code>) in the
        buffer, continue scanning
    <li><code >MATCH:</code> push the just read char back to the input, copy the non-pseudo
        character (i.e., other than AT_EOF) to the match-buffer, set
        <code >d_atBOL</code> to <code >true</code> if the last character in the <code >d_matched</code>
        buffer is <code >'\n'</code>, execute <code >postCode(PostEnum_::RETURN)</code>, execute
        the rule's actions, continue scanning (but the action may end
        <code >lex</code>'s call).
    <li><code >ECHO1ST:</code> echo the 1st char. of the buffer to stderr, set <code >d_atBOL</code>
        to <code >true</code> if that character equals <code >'\n'</code>, otherwise to <code >false</code>,
        return all but the first character in the buffer back to the input,
        call <code >postCode(PostEnum_::WIP)</code>, continue scanning.
    <li><code >ECHOCHAR:</code> echo the just read character to stderr, set <code >d_atBOL</code>
        to <code >true</code> if that character equals <code >'\n'</code>, otherwise to <code >false</code>,
        continue scanning.
    <li><code >RETURN:</code> if <code >popStream</code> returns false, then execute
        <code >postCode(PostEnum_::END)</code> and member <code >lex_</code> returns with token
        value 0; otherwise <code >postCode(PostEnum_::POP)</code> is called and
        processing continues.
</ul>
<p>
The data member <code >d_atBOL</code> is also set to <code >true</code> when <code >lex_</code> switches to
another input stream (either a new one, or returning to a previously stacked
one). This handles the borderline case where a file's last line is not
properly terminated with a <code >'\n'</code> character.
<p>
<a name="l67"></a>
<h3 >6.17.1: Handling BOL-rules</h3>
        The member <code >ScannerBase::knownFinalState</code> (implemented in <code >ScannerBase.h</code>
returns
        <pre>

    (d_atBOL &amp;&amp; available(d_final.atBOL.rule)) 
    || 
    available(d_final.notAtBOL.rule);
        
</pre>

    only if this is true, <code >ScannerBase::actionType_</code> returns
<code >ActionType_::MATCH</code>.

Three variables are used here, resulting in 8 possibilities:

<h2 >6.18: Run-time handling of LOP-patterns</h2>
    <code >ScannerBase.h</code> adds the following data members to <code >ScannerBase.h</code>:
        <pre>

    int             d_lopSC = 0;        // the active SC when lop1_() 
                                        // is called
    std::string     d_lopMatched;       // matched lop-rule characters 
    std::string::iterator d_lopTail;    // iterator pointing to the first 
                                        // character of the tail the scanner
                                        // is trying to match against {tail}.
    std::string::iterator d_lopEnd;     // iterator indicating the end of the
                                        // text to match agains {tail} or the
                                        // end of the text to match against
                                        // {head}
    std::string::iterator d_lopIter;    // iterator iterating from d_lopTail
                                        // to d_lopEnd while trying to match
                                        // {tail}
    size_t          d_lopPending;       // # pending input chars when lop1_
                                        // is called
                                        // pointer to the input function.
    size_t (\@Base::*d_get)() = &amp;\@Base::getInput;
        
</pre>

<p>
After matching tt{{head}{tail}) of fixed length tail LOP rules, the matched
text is first processed by <code >lopf_(tailLength)</code>, before the LOP rule's
original action block is executed. If fixed length tail LOP rules are used,
then <code >lopf_(tailLength)</code> is implemented in <code >lex.cc</code> and looks like this:
        <pre>

    void ScannerBase::lopf_(size_t tail)
    {
        tail = length() - tail;
        push(d_matched.substr(tail, string::npos));
        d_matched.resize(tail);
    }
        
</pre>

    This member simply pushes the last <code >tail</code> number of characters back to
the input stream, and removes them from <code >d_matched</code>.
<p>
After matching tt{{head}{tail}) of variable length tail LOP rules,
<code >lop1_(size_t lopSc)</code> is called. This member prepares the scanner for
finding the shortest tail. It's implementation is:
        <pre>

    void ScannerBase::lop1_(int lopSC)
    {
        d_lopMatched = d_matched;               // local copy of the matched
                                                // text
        d_lopPending = d_input.nPending();      // remember the # of pending
                                                // characters in Input's queue
        d_lopEnd = d_lopMatched.end();          // initialize the iterators
        d_lopTail = d_lopEnd - 1;               // to the final substring
        d_lopIter = d_lopTail;                  // of one character
    
        d_get = &amp;ScannerBase::getLOP;           // obtain characters from
                                                // d_lopIter
    
        d_lopSC = d_startCondition;             // remember original SC
        begin(SC(lopSC));                       // activate the 
                                                // tail-matching SC
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Note the used of the member <code >Input::nPending</code>. This member is added to
the class <code >Input's</code> interface and should return the number of characters
currently in the <code >Input</code> object's pending queue. In the default
implementation it simply returns the <code >Input</code> object's <code >d_deque</code>'s length.
<p>
To match the shortest tail <code >lop2_</code> and <code >lop3_</code> are used. The member
<code >lop3_</code> is called when the current tail characters do not match
<code >{tail}</code>. It increments the tail, and resets <code >d_lopIter</code>:
        <pre>

    void ScannerBase::lop3_()
    {
        d_lopIter = --d_lopTail;                // increase the tail
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The member <code >lop2_</code> is called when <code >{tail}</code> has been matched. It defines
the initial characters, up to <code >d_lopTail</code> as the characters to match agains
<code >{head}</code> and starts the next next start condition, which handles the matched
<code >{head}</code>. Here is <code >lop2_</code>'s implementation:
        <pre>

    void ScannerBase::lop2_()
    {
        d_lopEnd = d_lopTail;                   // read the head
        d_lopIter = d_lopMatched.begin();
                                                
        begin(SC(d_startCondition + 1));        // switch to the head-matching
                                                // SC
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Finally, <code >lop4_</code> returns the scanner to its original state, having matched
<code >{head}</code>, and pushes the remaining characters (the actual tail) on to the
input stream:
        <pre>

    void ScannerBase::lop4_()
    {
        begin(SC(d_lopSC));                     // restore original SC
        d_get = &amp;ScannerBase::getInput;         // restore get function
    
        d_input.setPending(d_lopPending);       // reduce # pending chars to
                                                // the original number

                                                // reinsert the tail into the 
                                                // input stream
        push(d_lopMatched.substr(length(), string::npos));
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
As stated in the code, the member <code >Input::setPending</code> resets the number
of pending characters to its original value. Its default implementation is
        <pre>

    void setPending(size_t size)
    {
        d_deque.erase(d_deque.begin(), d_deque.end() - size);
    }
        
</pre>

<h2 >6.19: Reflex: refreshing flexc++</h2>
    When a new <strong >flexc++</strong> release is prepared (resulting from 
a minor or major upgrade or even rewrite) several steps should be
performed before the new version is released. <strong >Flexc++</strong> should at least be able to
regenerate its own lexical scanner function <code >lex()</code>. 
<p>
In <strong >flexc++</strong>'s distribution the shell script <code >reflex</code> is found. In an
interactive process it performs the required steps by which <strong >flexc++</strong> recreates
its own scanner. The script assumes that a new binary program, representing
the latest changes, is available as <code >./tmp/bin/flexc++</code>, relative to the
directory in which the <code >reflex</code> script is found. When creating <code >flexc++</code>
with the provided <code >build</code> script, these assumptions are automatically met.
<p>
The <code >reflex</code> script then performs the following steps:
    <ul>
    <li> It optionally creates and always cleans a working directory
<code >./self</code>. 
<p>
<li> It copies <code >scanner/lexer</code> to <code >./self</code>, allowing <strong >flexc++</strong> to create a
separate <code >lex.cc</code> and <code >Scannerbase.h</code>.
<p>
<li> In <code >./self</code> it executes 
        <pre>

    ../tmp/bin/flexc++ -S ../skeletons lexer
        
</pre>

        by which the new <strong >flexc++</strong> program creates a scanner from its own scanner
specification file.<br/>
        At this point realize that the new <strong >flexc++</strong> program still uses a
<code >lex()</code> function that was created by an older scanner generator.
<p>
<li> Before taking this step <em >make sure that the original <code >lex.cc</code> and
<code >scannerbase.h</code> files were properly backed up</em>.<br/>
    The files <code >lex.cc</code> and <code >Scannerbase.h</code>, created in the previous step
are now copied to the <code >./scanner</code> directory.
<p>
<li> All of the sources of the <code >Scanner</code> and <code >Parser</code> classes as well
as <code >flexc++.cc</code> itself must now be recompiled, unless absolutely no changes
were made to the <code >Scanner</code>'s internal data organization were made, in which
case <code >build program</code> will only recompile the modified source file
<code >./scanner/lex.cc</code>.<br/>
    At this point a new <strong >flexc++</strong> program has been created, using a <code >lex.cc</code>
implementation generated by the latest release of <strong >flexc++</strong>.
<p>
<li> Once again execute in <code >./self</code>
        <pre>

    ../tmp/bin/flexc++ -S ../skeletons lexer
        
</pre>

        by which <strong >flexc++</strong> creates a scanner from its own scanner
specification file, now using its own generated implementation of the
<code >lex()</code> function in <code >lex.cc</code>.
<p>
<li> If <code >diff ./scanner/lex.cc self/</code> only shows different time
stamps and if <code >diff ./scanner/Scannerbase.h self/</code> also 
only shows different time stamps, then <strong >flexc++</strong> could recreate its own matching
function and a stable new release has been created.
