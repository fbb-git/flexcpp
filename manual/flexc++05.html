<h1 >Chapter 5: Pre-loading input lines</h1>
In some programs it may be desirable to have the currently scanned line
available, even though all its contents hasn't been read yet by <strong >flexc++</strong>.
<p>
E.g., when the <code >g++</code> compiler detects an error or warning it displays the
full line in which the error or warning condition arose, as well as a column
indicator indicating where the condition was observed (below, a condition
where the current input line should be displayed is simply called a
`condition').
<p>
<strong >Flexc++</strong> could use one of the following approaches to provide the required
condition information:
    <ul>
    <li> At each end of line <strong >flexc++</strong> could store the current offset of the file
        it is reading. Furthermore, each rule adds <code >length()</code> to a data
        member keeping track of the length of the line read so far, making
        this data member's value available through an accessor (e.g.,
        <code >column()</code>). After each newline this data member is reset to zero.
<p>
The code calling the scanner's <code >lex</code> member maintains a data
        member holding the offset that was last returned by the scanner, as
        well as a `condition vector' whose elements contain column numbers and
        messages describing the nature of the conditions. 
<p>
When the code calling the scanner's <code >lex</code> member observes a
        condition it compares the offset returned by the scanner to its
        own offset data member. 
<p>
If the two offset values differ the source file's line that begins at
        the code's offset data member is read, so this line
        can be shown together with a column indicator and a message describing
        the condition for each of the lements of the condition
        vector. Following this, the condition vector is erased, and the
        scanner provided offset is assigned to the code's own offset data
        member.
<p>
If the two offset values are equal the scanner's 
        <code >column</code> value and the nature of the condition are added to a
        `condition vector'.
<p>
This approach has the advantage of being relatively simple. A
        disadvantage could be that it can only be used for seekable media, or
        that the overhead of seeking and reading lines of the file that is
        processed by <strong >flexc++</strong> is considered impractical.
<p>
The implementation of this approach is left as an exercise to the
        reader.
<p>
<li> The scanner could read lines one at a time, followed by rereading the
        line so that it can be broken down into tokens by the scanner. This
        approach is discussed and implemented in the next section.
<p>
<li> Streams offering the contents and last-read column positions of the
        currently scanned line could be passed to the scanner. This approach
        is discussed and implemented in the final section of this chapter.
    </ul>

<h2 >5.1: Using start conditions to pre-load input lines</h2>
    Since the scanner has full control over what happens before and after
determining the next token, the lexical scanner's rules can be designed so
that it always first reads a line, and then re-reads that line in another
start condition. The <code >Scanner</code> object keeps the last-read line, a column
indicator, and a reset flag, which is initially set to <code >true</code> and also after
reading a newline. If the reset flag is true, the column indicator is set to
0, otherwise it is updated to the length of the currently matched text. Here
is the initial section of the class <code >Scanner</code>, showing the new data members:
        <pre>

    class Scanner: public ScannerBase
    {
        std::string d_storedLine;
        size_t d_column = 0;
        bool d_reset = true;
    
        public:
        ...
    };
        
</pre>

<p>
Of course, the lexer won't return for all matched text, but once a rule has
been matched the <code >posCode</code> member is called, so this function can update the
column and reset indicators:
<p>
<pre>

    void Scanner::postCode(PostEnum_ type) 
    {
        if (not d_reset)
            d_column += length();
        else
        {
            d_reset = false;
            d_column = 0;
        }
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The scanner's default rule (the <code >StartCondition_::INITIAL</code> scanner simply
reads the initial line, and then pushes the line back onto the scanner's
queue. A simple <code >.*</code> will ensure that all the line's characters are
read. Having matched a line it must still be broken down into tokens, for
which the <code >%x main</code> start condition is used. The default (<code >INITIAL</code>)
scanner's rule looks like this:
<p>
<pre>

    .*                                  {
                                            d_storedLine = matched();
                                            push(d_storedLine);
                                            begin(StartCondition_::main);
                                            d_reset = true;
                                        }
        
</pre>

<p>
Now that the line has been stored, it's time to obtain its tokens, which is
the responsibility of the <code >StartCondition_::main</code> start condition:
<p>
<pre>

    &lt;main&gt;{
        [ \t]+                              // skip white space chars.
        [0-9]+                              return NUMBER;
        [[:alpha:]_][[:alpha:][:digit:]_]*  return IDENTIFIER;
        [][]                                return SIGNAL;
        .                                   return matched()[0];
        \n                                  begin(StartCondition_::INITIAL);
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
Identifiers and numbers are returned as tokens, square brackets are returned
as <code >SIGNAL</code> tokens, indicating that we would like to see the lines and
columns in which they were found, white space characters are ignored, and 
all other characters are returned as-is.
<p>
Once a token is returned, <code >d_column</code> is updated to indicate the column
number of the last-matched character. To obtain the matched text's 
initial column number, subtract <code >length() - 1</code>.
<p>
Here is a simple <code >main</code> function, reading its <code >cin</code> stream, and showing
lines, column indicators, line numbers, and column numbers of detected square
brackets:
<p>
<pre >
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
#include "scanner.h"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    Scanner scanner;        // define a Scanner object

    while (int token = scanner.lex())   // get all tokens
    {
        string const &amp;text = scanner.matched();
        switch (token)
        {
            case IDENTIFIER:
                cout &lt;&lt; "identifier: " &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; '\n';
            break;

            case NUMBER:
                cout &lt;&lt; "number: " &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; '\n';
            break;

            case SIGNAL:
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; 
                        '\n' &lt;&lt;
                        scanner.line() &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;
                        setw(scanner.column()) &lt;&lt; '^' &lt;&lt; "\n"
                        "Line " &lt;&lt; scanner.lineNr() &lt;&lt; ", column " &lt;&lt;
                        scanner.column() &lt;&lt; 
                                ": saw `" &lt;&lt; scanner.matched() &lt;&lt; "'\n\n";
            }
            break;

            default:
                cout &lt;&lt; "char. token: `" &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; "'\n";
            break;
        }
    }
}

<h2 >5.2: Wrapping input streams</h2>
    Streams offering the contents and last-read column positions of the
currently scanned line could be passed to the scanner. The streams that are
processed by the scanner become <em >wrapper streams</em> around the streams that
are actually processed by the scanner. 
<p>
This approach uses multiple inheritance to add <code >std::streambuf</code> and
<code >std::istream</code> facilities to the <code >class Scanner</code>. However, these
facilities are for internal use only: they are merely used for wrapping the
<code >std::istream</code> that is actually passed to the scanner.
<p>
Once the set of files have been generated from the rules file (e.g.,
<code >lexer</code>) the file <code >Scanner.h</code> is available, and this file will be slightly
modified: we'll use triple inheritance for the  <code >class Scanner</code>:
<p>
<pre>

class Scanner: private ScannerStreambuf, private std::istream, 
               public ScannerBase 
    
</pre>

<p>
Only for the <code >ScannerBase</code> public inheritance is used: the initial two
classes are used to implement <code >Scanner</code> in terms of these classes. The class
<code >IStreambuf</code> is doing all the magic and is discussed below. The
<code >std::istream</code> base class receives <code >ScannerStreambuf</code>'s address, turning
<code >Scanner</code> objects into <code >std::istream</code> objects, but only so for the benefit
of the <code >Scanner</code> object itself. <code >ScannerBase</code>, of course, is left
untouched. 
<p>
The class <code >ScannerStreambuf</code> maintains and offers the contents of the
currently scanned line and column numbers of returned characters. The
<code >Scanner</code>'s interface shares its members <code >line</code> and <code >column</code> to make
this information available to any class that may access the <code >Scanner</code>
object. To accomplish this the following declarations are added <code >Scanner</code>'s
public interface:
        <pre>

    using ScannerStreambuf::line;
    using ScannerStreambuf::column;
        
</pre>

<p>
The member <code >explicit Scanner(std::istream &amp;in = std::cin, std::ostream &amp;out
= std::cout)</code> now must make sure the <code >ScannerStreambuf</code> and <code >std::istream</code>
are properly initialized before the <code >ScannerBase</code> can be initialized. 
the <code >ScannerStreambuf</code> is a wrapper around the actual <code >std::istream</code>, and
it receives the initial stream from the constructor's arguments. This
completes the <code >ScannerStreambuf</code> construction, making <code >std::istream's
std::streambuffer</code> available. The interesting part comes next: now that the
<code >Scanner</code> is an <code >std::istream</code> it can simply be passed to <code >ScannerBase</code>
as the input file to be processed (cf. figure <a href="flexc++05.html#inputwrapping">1</a>).
<p>
<p><a name="inputwrapping"></a><figure >
<img src="images/inputwrapping.jpg" >
<figcaption >Figure 1: Scanner: triple inheritance</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>
The code implementing this organization looks like this:
<p>
<pre>

    Scanner::Scanner(std::istream &amp;in, std::ostream &amp;out)
    :
        ScannerStreambuf(cin),
        istream(this),
        ScannerBase(*this, cout)
    {}
        
</pre>

<p>

<h3 >5.2.1: The class ScannerStreambuf</h3>
        The class <code >ScannerStreambuf</code> uses two data members (<code >d_line</code> and
<code >d_column</code>) to store, respectively, the line that's currently being scanned
and the column to where the scanning process has proceeded. In addition it
needs access to the actual input stream (in this example only one stream is
used, so a <code >std::istream &amp;d_in</code> can be used; if stream-switching should be
supported then use a <code >std::istream *d_inPtr</code>), and it uses a one-character
buffer (there's no real need to use a bigger buffer, as the input stream may
already define its own buffer, and the scanner merely reads its input one
character at the time anyway (through <code >Input::get</code>).
<p>
<code >ScannerStreambuf</code> only needs a very basic interface:
        <pre>

    class ScannerStreambuf: public std::streambuf
    {
        std::istream &amp;d_in;
        std::string d_line;
        size_t d_column = 0;
        char d_ch;
    
        public:
            ScannerStreambuf(std::istream &amp;in);
    
            std::string const &amp;line() const;
            size_t column() const;
    
        private:
            int underflow() override;    
    };
        
</pre>

    The members <code >line</code> and <code >column</code> are simple accessors, returning,
respectively <code >d_line</code> and <code >d_column</code>. The constructor initializes <code >d_in</code>
and installs an empty buffer:
        <pre>

    ScannerStreambuf::ScannerStreambuf(istream &amp;in)
    :
        d_in(in)
    {
        setg(0, 0, 0);
    }
        
</pre>

<p>
The member <code >underflow</code> isn't complicated either: if all characters in
<code >d_line</code> have been processed (which is initially true) the next line is read
into <code >d_line</code>, adding a newline character to <code >d_line</code>. 
<p>
Then the next character in <code >d_line</code> is assigned to <code >d_ch</code>, and the
input buffer is defined to point at <code >d_ch</code>. Here is its implementation:
        <pre>

    int ScannerStreambuf::underflow()
    {
        if (d_column == d_line.length())
        {
            if (!getline(d_in, d_line))
                return EOF;
    
            d_column = 0;
            d_line += '\n';
        }
        d_ch = d_line[d_column++];
        setg(&amp;d_ch, &amp;d_ch, &amp;d_ch + 1);
        return *gptr();
    }
        
</pre>

<h3 >5.2.2: Illustration</h3>
        Here is a set of lexer-rules which is used to illustrate the various
approaches with:
<p>
<pre >
%filenames scanner

%%

[ \t\n]+                            // skip white space chars.
[0-9]+                              return NUMBER;
[[:alpha:]_][[:alpha:][:digit:]_]*  return IDENTIFIER;
[][]                                return SIGNAL;
.                                   return matched()[0];




</pre>

<p>
Identifiers and numbers are returned as tokens, square brackets are returned
as <code >SIGNAL</code> tokens, indicating that we would like to see the lines and
columns in which they were found, white space characters are ignored, and 
all other characters are returned as-is.
<p>
The <code >main</code> function uses the <code >column</code> and <code >line</code> members, which were
added to the <code >class Scanner</code>:
<p>
<pre >
int main()
{
    ScannerStreambuf buf(cin);
    istream in(&amp;buf);

    string line;

    Scanner scanner(in);                // define a Scanner object

    while (int token = scanner.lex())   // get all tokens
    {
        string const &amp;text = scanner.matched();
        switch (token)
        {
            case IDENTIFIER:
                cout &lt;&lt; "identifier: " &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; '\n';
            break;

            case NUMBER:
                cout &lt;&lt; "number: " &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; '\n';
            break;

            case SIGNAL:
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; 
                        '\n' &lt;&lt;
                        scanner.line() &lt;&lt; 
                        setw(scanner.column()) &lt;&lt; '^' &lt;&lt; "\n"
                        "Line " &lt;&lt; scanner.lineNr() &lt;&lt; ", column " &lt;&lt;
                        scanner.column() &lt;&lt; 
                                ": saw `" &lt;&lt; scanner.matched() &lt;&lt; "'\n\n";
            }
            break;

            default:
                cout &lt;&lt; "char. token: `" &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; "'\n";
            break;
        }
    }
}

</pre>

<p>
The <code >IStreambuf</code> wraps around <code >cin</code>, and is passed to an <code >istream</code>,
which in turn is passed to the <code >Scanner</code> object. When the scanner returns
<code >SIGNAL</code> tokens their lines, column indicators, line numbers and column
numbers are shown.
<p>
Members like <code >switchStream</code> and <code >pushStream</code>, expecting <code >std::istream</code>
references can also be used, if the actual input streams are wrapped in
<code >ScannerStreambuf</code> objects, which are passed to <code >istream</code> objects which
are, in turn, passed to <code >switchStream</code> and <code >pushStream</code>. The members
expecting names of streams should of course not be used, since the scanner
creates plain <code >std::ifstream</code> objects for them.
